/**
 * @defgroup drawings Drawings
 * @{
 * Drawings types and overview
 *
 * A drawing is basically any piece of markup built around
 * and idea or purpose and representing a self-contained unit.
 *
 * As any html markup drawings can have scripts and styles attached.
 * Practically there is no limit of what a drawing may be: charts, image galleries,
 * embedded video, js apps, LaTeX images etc.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup chain_plugins Workflows mechanics
 * @{
 * Chain plugins are base elements that compose a drawing building chain.
 *
 * Drawers, Adapters and Mappers are examples of chain plugins. They are
 * used by Mangers to build a chain that is used to create a drawing
 * based on a given resource. All chain plugins implement a common
 * method ::prepareBuild() that allows each plugin to modify $build and $resource
 * and transfer it further down the chain to finally get a ready drawing build.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup manager_plugins Manager plugins
 * @{
 * Managers are used to compose chain of plugins and create drawing build.
 *
 * Manager plugins main purpose is to compose a chain from adapter, mapper and
 * drawer plugins and apply it to the input resource object to get a drawing
 * build as a result.
 * Developers can create custom managers that would implement custom logic
 * if DefaultManager doesn't fit their needs.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup adapter_plugins Adapter plugins
 * @{
 * Adapters convert resources from one type to another.
 *
 * Adapter plugins allow to make drawers resource agnostic, i.e. they allow
 * to use the same drawer plugin with any resource type: from views output
 * to uploaded files or remote resources available over http or other protocols.
 *
 * Adapters are the key part of the VisualN which provides its flexibility
 * and integration with other Drupal UIs such as fields, blocks or views
 * without coding.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup mapper_plugins Mapper plugins
 * @{
 * Mappers change data keys to ones used by drawers.
 *
 * Mapper plugins allow users to set key mapping from ones used in resource
 * to ones expected by drawers.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup raw_resource_formats Raw Resource Format plugins
 * @{
 * Raw Resource Formats describe real physical resources used.
 *
 * Raw resources are the real "stuff" which is converted/translated into a resource object
 * to be used to build a drawing.
 * Due to arbitrary nature of possible physical resources no strict assumptions can be made
 * about their structure, origin or location that would be common
 * for all possible physical (real) resources.
 *
 * Though every real resource has some common features, namely a set of comprised/provided
 * values/parameters of some nature, expected type of resultant resource object and
 * the way (logic) to convert those input values/parameters into a resource object.
 * These features constitute real resource formats which are implemented
 * in form of Raw Resource Format plugins.
 *
 * The plugins are commonly used as an entry point into drawing building chain. They are
 * used by VisualN fields to let user explicitly select the format of file or url resource
 * or seamlessly when resource object is created.
 *
 * Raw Resource Format plugins have "group" key to let modules group formats by some criteria.
 * The "default" group tells that the format should be used to create a resource object
 * of a given type by default. See VisualN::getResourceByOptions() helper.
 *
 * Each format plugin must have "output" key set in its annotation. It defines the type
 * of resultant resource object produced by the plugin.
 * @}
 */

/**
 * @defgroup resource_proivder_plugins Resource providers
 * @{
 * Provide Resource objects objects to create drawings.
 *
 * Resource providers are typically used by Drawing Fetchers or Data Set entities
 * via Resource provider field type.
 * There is not limit on type or types of resources that a given Resource provider
 * may return. It is more about contents of the resource returned (information)
 * than about its type. In this point it differs from Raw Resource Format plugins
 * which also return a resource but are more about format of *raw* resources trying
 * to describe real envorinment than about contents of that raw resources. And also
 * being limited to one specific resource type.
